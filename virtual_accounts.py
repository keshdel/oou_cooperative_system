"""
Dedicated virtual accounts — a permanent bank account number per member.

Why this exists: the old way is a member transfers to the cooperative's account,
forgets the reference, sends a screenshot, and a treasurer posts it by hand. Here
each member gets their own NUBAN, so the account the money landed in *is* the
identity. Nothing is matched by hand and nothing depends on the member
remembering to quote anything.

Money arrives unannounced, which makes this different from every other payment
path in CoopMS. There is no pending row waiting for it and no member click that
says what it is for. So an inflow is handled in two steps:

  1. **Banked.**  Debit Cash & Bank, credit Unallocated Member Receipts (2010).
     The cooperative owes the member that money from the second it lands, and
     the books say so immediately — even though nobody has decided what it is
     for yet.
  2. **Applied.**  Debit 2010, credit savings or the member's loan. This is a
     separate decision, taken by the cooperative's allocation rule or by an
     officer, and it is reversible on its own.

Never guess a member. An inflow that cannot be matched to a member is parked as
``unmatched`` for an officer to look at, not silently absorbed.
