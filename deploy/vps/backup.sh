# Back up every client database, keep the last 14 days locally, and — when
# off-site storage is configured — copy each dump somewhere the server cannot
# reach on its own.
#
# Why off-site matters: a backup that lives on the machine it protects is not a
# backup. One deleted droplet, one ransomware run, one billing lapse, and the
# societies' records go with the server.
#
# Run nightly via cron (see README). Each client is dumped separately so one can
# be restored without touching the others.
#
# Off-site is optional and off until configured. In deploy/vps/.env:
#
#   OFFSITE_BUCKET=coopms-backups          # required to switch it on
#   OFFSITE_ENDPOINT=https://fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com
#   OFFSITE_REGION=fra1
#   OFFSITE_PREFIX=vps1                    # optional folder inside the bucket
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...                  # the Spaces/S3 key
#   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
#   BACKUP_PASSPHRASE=...                  # optional; encrypts before upload
#
# The bucket must be private. These dumps contain members' names, savings and
# loan histories.
